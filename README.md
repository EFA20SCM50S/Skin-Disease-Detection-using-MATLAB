# Skin-Disease-Detection-using-MATLAB
Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells when the skin often gets exposed to the sunlight
There are three major types of skin cancer â€” basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma
In this, melanoma is the most common type of skin cancer among people with fair skin
It occurs when the pigment-producing cells that give colour to the skin becomes cancerous
Early detection of melanoma can be curable
For this, we propose an image processing-based approach to diagnose the skin cancer
Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment's other than a camera and a computer
